## 1. Introduction

In todayâ€™s increasingly interconnected world, the security of network infrastructures is paramount. This project addresses the need for proactive security measures by leveraging Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to monitor network traffic in real-time, detect anomalies, and automate threat mitigation. With a web-based dashboard, the system provides intuitive visualization and forensic analysis capabilities.

## 2. Problem Statement

This project aims to develop an SDN-based system that provides real-time network forensics and anomaly detection to enhance the security and visibility of network traffic. The system will log traffic flows, detect anomalies such as DDoS attacks, and allow for immediate forensic analysis and mitigation of security threats through an intuitive web-based dashboard.

## 3. Objectives

- To design and implement a real-time network forensics system using SDN that logs network traffic flows and detects security anomalies.
- To provide a user-friendly web-based interface that visualizes network traffic data, alerts on detected anomalies, and enables rapid forensic analysis and response.

## 5. Requirements

### 5.1 Functional Requirements

1. **Traffic Flow Logging**: The system must log all network traffic flows in real-time using the SDN controller.
   
2. **Anomaly Detection**: The system must detect security anomalies such as DDoS attacks and port scans.

3. **Automated Response**: Upon detecting an anomaly, the SDN controller should modify flow rules to block or mitigate malicious traffic.

4. **Web Dashboard**: The system must provide a web-based dashboard that visualizes traffic data, displays alerts, and enables forensic analysis.

5. **API for External Integration**: The system should expose APIs to allow external systems or tools to retrieve traffic logs and anomaly alerts.

### 5.2 Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability**: The system should be able to handle a large number of traffic flows and scale as the network grows.

2. **Performance**: The system must detect anomalies and respond to them with minimal delay to maintain real-time functionality.

3. **Security**: The system should ensure that logs and sensitive data are protected from unauthorized access.

4. **Usability**: The dashboard should be intuitive and easy for security analysts to use, offering clear visualizations and actionable insights.

5. **Reliability**: The system should have minimal downtime and ensure consistent traffic logging and anomaly detection.
